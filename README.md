## **Motivation**

Developers frequently write about code, and it's good practice to write a tutorial.

## **What Problem does this solve and how was a solution accomplished?**

Practice writing about code by creating a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does.

## **What makes this project stand out?**

<br/>

## **Challenge Criteria**

AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines

-   GIVEN a regex tutorial<br/>

-   WHEN I open the tutorial<br/>
    THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile

-   WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents<br/>
    THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial

-   WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial<br/>
    THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does

-   WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial<br/>
    THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile

    <br/>
